# NSE Intraday Trading Bot — Project Context

> Last updated: 2026-05-01 (rework session). This file is rewritten directly from the live code (`config.py`, `scanner.py`, `risk_manager.py`, `order_manager.py`, `options_manager.py`, all 4 active strategy files) to replace stale Sniper Mode V1/V2 sections that no longer matched the codebase.

---

## REWORK 2026-05-01 (most recent)

Session goals: rework toward options-primary at Rs.30K capital, fix F&O execution bug, set up Windows Task Scheduler for daily auto-paper-trading.

### What changed

1. **Capital raised to Rs.30K** (`.env: INITIAL_CAPITAL=30000`)
2. **Mode flipped to PAPER by default** (`.env: PAPER_TRADING=True`) — REAL orders disabled until you flip back
3. **Options-primary capital split**: F&O Rs.21K (70%), Equity Rs.9K (30%)
4. **Equity-disable toggle added**: `config.equity_enabled` — set False to run options-only
5. **F&O daily limit raised**: 2 → 4 trades (was hardcoded in `options_manager.py`, now reads `config.options_max_trades_per_day`)
6. **F&O premium cap raised**: Rs.500 → Rs.700 (BANKNIFTY needs higher)
7. **CRITICAL F&O BUG FIXED**: `broker._lookup_option_token` was importing a non-existent function `get_instrument_master` from `utils.watchlist` — every options token lookup raised ImportError silently swallowed by try/except, so NO F&O trade ever placed an order despite `options_enabled=True`. Fixed to read instrument master JSON directly from `logs/scrip_master.json` cache (downloads if missing). User confirmed: F&O was never tested live, only via backtest, so this is a forward fix not a regression.
8. **Windows Task Scheduler set up**: Daily 8:55 AM auto-launch in paper mode. Task name: `NSE-IntradayBot-Paper`. Uses `start_bot_paper.bat` wrapper.
9. **GitHub backup**: `origin = git@github-studytimer:rshivam34/nse-trading-bot.git`. All rework commits pushed.

### Why options-primary

Empirical evidence:
- 2-week relaxed-VIX backtest: equity -Rs.4 (2 trades), options +Rs.633 (1 trade)
- 12 March 2026 live equity trades: ~-Rs.700 net (charges + losses)
- F&O bug meant zero options trades fired live (hidden zero) — but backtest shows the strategy *would* work
- At Rs.15K-30K capital, equity per-trade max gain (~Rs.225) is ~2× round-trip charges (Rs.30-50). F&O premium movement is asymmetric — same effort, much better R/R

### Why VIX cutoff stays at 18

User's deliberate choice. 6-month VIX history (Nov 2025 - Apr 2026):
- Nov-Feb: VIX 9-15 → 80 of 80 days tradeable
- Mar-Apr: VIX 17-28 (war/crisis) → 5 of 39 days tradeable
- Total: 85 of 119 days (71%) at VIX < 18

The Mar-Apr crisis is the OUTLIER, not the rule. Cutoff at 18 protects from crisis whipsaw (March's 12 live trades = -Rs.700 net) while not blocking normal markets. Historical March 2026 SHORTs at VIX 22-26 were unanimously losers; user is correct to stay out.

### How to start trading

**Paper mode (auto-runs daily at 8:55 AM via Task Scheduler):**
```powershell
# Already set up. Verify with:
Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName "NSE-IntradayBot-Paper"
```
The bot self-skips weekends and NSE holidays. Logs go to `backend/logs/trading_bot_YYYY-MM-DD.log`.

**Manual run:**
```powershell
cd C:\Users\rshiv\nse-trading-bot\backend
python main.py --paper       # paper mode (default in .env)
python main.py --live        # LIVE — REAL money
```

**Options-only mode:** edit `config.py` line ~325 → `equity_enabled: bool = False`

**Disable Task Scheduler auto-run:**
```powershell
Unregister-ScheduledTask -TaskName "NSE-IntradayBot-Paper" -Confirm:$false
```

## What This Project Is

An automated intraday trading system for the Indian stock market (NSE). It actually contains **TWO independent trading systems running inside one bot process**:

| System | What it trades | Manager class |
|---|---|---|
| **A. Equity Intraday** | NIFTY 200 stocks, MIS leveraged | `core/order_manager.py` |
| **B. Index Options (F&O)** | NIFTY + BANKNIFTY weekly ATM options | `core/options_manager.py` |

Both share the same Angel One auth, kill switch, force-exit timer (3:15 PM), and VIX gate — but their entry pipelines, position sizing, exits, and trade-count limits are completely separate.

**Two parts:**
1. **Python Backend** (`/backend`) — Runs on user's laptop during market hours. Angel One SmartAPI for orders, WebSocket for live ticks, REST polling for VIX (Yahoo Finance fallback).
2. **React Dashboard** (`/dashboard`) — GitHub Pages, reads real-time data from Firebase. Shows signals, positions, P&L, trade history. Has kill switch + trading enable/disable toggle.

## Architecture

```

```

## Capital & Mode

- **Initial capital:** Rs.15,000 (set in `.env: INITIAL_CAPITAL`, default 15000)
- **Effective buying power:** ~Rs.60,000 (cash × 4× MIS leverage estimate)
- **Mode toggles** (in `.env`):
  - `PAPER_TRADING=True/False` — paper vs live
  - `SUGGEST_ONLY=True/False` — log signals without executing
- **CLI overrides:** `python main.py --live` or `--paper`

---

## SYSTEM A: Equity Intraday (4 active strategies)

### Active strategies (loaded in `scanner.py:71-76`)
1. **ORB** (`orb_strategy.py`) — Opening Range Breakout with retest confirmation
2. **VWAP_BOUNCE** (`vwap_strategy.py`) — VWAP support/resistance bounce
3. **EMA_CROSS** (`ema_strategy.py`) — 9/21 EMA crossover on completed candles
4. **SR_BREAKOUT** (`sr_breakout_strategy.py`) — Prev day H/L/C + 5-day swing breakouts

> The folder also contains `vwap_reversion_strategy.py` and `options_strategy.py` — these are **NOT loaded by the live scanner**. The first is used only by the backtest; the second is referenced by `options_manager.py` indirectly (the options manager reimplements its own ORB-retest state machine for live trading).

### Each strategy's exact entry rules

| Strategy | Trigger | SL | Target | Time window |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **ORB** | 9:15-9:30 range size 0.5%-2% → previous **completed candle close** past range + 0.15% buffer (state: BREAKOUT) → price pulls back within 0.2% of broken edge (state: RETESTING) → next completed candle closes back past edge as green/red with ≥1.5× volume | Opposite ORB edge | 1.5× range width | **9:30 – 10:15 only** |
| **VWAP_BOUNCE** | Stock above (or below) VWAP for ≥6 completed candles → 2-candle bounce: prev candle touched within 0.3% of VWAP and closed across as green/red, current candle confirms same direction → volume ≥ 1.5× avg → RSI not >75 (LONG) / <25 (SHORT) → sector not LAGGING/WEAKENING | 0.4% beyond VWAP | max(swing high/low, 1.5R) | **9:30 – 11:30 only** |
| **EMA_CROSS** | EMA9 crosses EMA21 on completed candles (not ticks) → separation ≥ 0.15% (filters noise) → volume ≥ 20-candle avg → RSI 30-70 → price on correct side of VWAP | Recent 10-candle low/high × 0.998 (LONG) / 1.002 (SHORT) | 1.5R | No cutoff |
| **SR_BREAKOUT** | Price > 0.1% past prev day H/L/C or 5-day swing → volume ≥ 2.0× last completed candle vs 20-candle avg → NIFTY direction not opposite → on correct side of VWAP | 1% inside broken level | next key level OR 1.5R, whichever further | No cutoff (only 1× per stock per level per day) |

All four require: NIFTY direction not opposite, gap < 1.5%, no signal yet on this stock today.

### The full equity scan pipeline (`scanner.py:scan` line 317)

For every stock tick after 9:30 AM:

```
1. Skip if already signaled this stock today
2. Skip if news flagged stock (skip_today)
3. Skip if earnings this week
4. Build 5-min candles from ticks (OHLCV)
5. Build context (VWAP, RSI, EMA9/21, RVOL, ADV, gap%)
6. Run ALL 4 strategies → collect raw signals
7. Pick highest-confidence signal (NO confluence requirement — Option C)
8. Compute ATR(14), Choppiness, 15m trend

   FILTER CHAIN — any failure = REJECT:
9.  VIX > 18 .................. SKIPPED-VIX-GATE
10. Stock Choppiness > 70 ...... SKIPPED-CHOPPY
11. NIFTY Choppiness > 70 ...... SKIPPED-CHOPPY
12. 15-min trend opposite ...... DISABLED in config (trend_15m_enabled=False)
13. Breakout candle didn't close
    past level (ORB/SR only) ... SKIPPED-NO-CANDLE-CLOSE

14. Score the signal (signal_scorer.py — 14 factors, see below)

    SCORE MODIFIERS:
15. ATR compressing? → -10 OR HARD REJECT for ORB/SR_BREAKOUT
16. RVOL <1×: -10  |  1-2×: -5  |  ≥3×: +5
17. VWAP_BOUNCE at VIX > 18: -15 (rarely fires — VIX>18 already blocks)
18. After 12:00, NIFTY exhausted (40%+ giveback): -15
19. After 14:00: -5

20. Score < 80? → SKIPPED-LOW-SCORE
21. Recalculate SL/target using ATR (overrides what strategy set)
22. Mark signal QUALIFIED → main.py executes pipeline
```

### Risk manager gate (`risk_manager.py:can_trade` line 201)

After scanner returns a qualified signal, this runs before the order is placed:

```
Rule 1:  trades_today < min(5, stance_max_trades)            # HARD daily cap
Rule 2:  losses_today < 3                                     # max losses today
Rule 3:  daily_pnl > -3% of starting capital                  # daily loss limit
Rule 4:  current time <= 13:00                                # no_new_trades_after
Rule 5:  in trading window (9:30-13:00)
Rule 6:  not in 15-min consecutive-loss cooldown (after 2 in a row)
Rule 6b: ≥10 min since last entry (entry spacing — prevents correlated bets)
Rule 7:  not already in position on this stock
Rule 7b: not in 15-min re-entry cooldown for this stock
Rule 8:  signal has stop-loss
Rule 9:  signal RR ≥ 1.0
Rule 10: position size > 0 after VIX/stance/regime scaling
Rule 11: capital deployed < 80% of broker margin
Rule 12: expected net profit > Rs.15 (or Rs.8/Rs.12 if capital < Rs.5K/2K)
```

### Pre-flight checklist (`order_manager.py:pre_flight_check` line 426)

After risk manager passes, this 17-point check runs:

| # | Check | Source |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Score ≥ 80 | config.min_score_to_trade |
| 2 | Scanner pipeline passed (informational) | always pass — confluence removed |
| 3 | RVOL informational | always pass — score modifier handles it |
| 4 | VIX ≤ 18 | re-check at order time |
| 5 | Lunch flag (informational) | always pass |
| 6 | trades_today < 5 | risk manager |
| 7 | losses_today < 3 | risk manager |
| 8 | Stock CHOP ≤ 70 | scanner-set on signal |
| 9 | NIFTY CHOP ≤ 70 | scanner market context |
| 10 | 15m trend aligned | DISABLED (trend_15m_enabled=False) |
| 11 | Candle close confirmed | pre-verified in scanner |
| 12 | SL distance 1.0%-1.5% | ATR floor/ceiling |
| 13 | Risk within limits | always pass |
| 14 | Capital deployed < 80% | risk manager |
| 15 | Not in re-entry cooldown | risk manager |
| 16 | Time 9:30-13:00 | window check |
| 17 | Estimated net profit > Rs.15 | brokerage calculator |

### Scoring breakdown (`signal_scorer.py`)

A signal must score **≥80/100** to execute. 14 factors:

| Factor | Max | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| ORB strategy | +15 | strategy_name == "ORB" |
| VWAP aligned | +15 | LONG above VWAP / SHORT below |
| Volume spike | +20 (≥5×) or +10 (≥2×) | RVOL |
| RSI 30-70 | +10 | not extreme |
| NIFTY aligned | +15 (or +8 if NEUTRAL) | direction matches |
| EMA aligned | +10 | EMA9 vs EMA21 matches direction |
| vs prev close | +5 | LONG above / SHORT below |
| News sentiment | +10 (or +4 if neutral) | matches direction |
| Away from prev levels | +5 | not within 0.3% of prev H/L/C |
| Time bonus | +5 | 9:30-11:30 or 13:00-14:30 |
| Low VIX | +5 (or +3 if no data) | VIX < 15 |
| **Macro aligned** | +10 / -10 | NIFTY 50/200 DMA trend matches |
| **Sector aligned** | +5 / -5 | LEADING/IMPROVING vs LAGGING/WEAKENING |
| **Fundamental** | -10 + ±5 | red flag (ROE<10%, D/E>2, EPS<0) + PE vs sector |

Total capped at 100. Score 80+ = "EXCELLENT", 90+ = "EXCEPTIONAL".

### Execution flow (`order_manager.py:execute` line 591)

1. Margin check — reduce qty if needed
2. Place LIMIT order (3 retries, 2s/4s backoff)
3. Poll fill status (3 checks, 1s apart)
4. If filled: place broker-side STOPLOSS-LIMIT order (exchange-level safety net)
5. If unfilled after 3s: leaves order pending → `_check_pending_timeouts` either adopts late fill or cancels at 30s

### Position monitoring (`order_manager.py:monitor_positions` line 755)

Runs every second in trading loop. Priority order:

1. Effective SL hit → exit
2. Trailing SL hit → exit
3. After 15:00, position in profit → exit (TIME_PROFIT_EXIT)
4. Partial exit at 1.0R → sell 50%, move SL to breakeven, activate trailing
5. Full target hit (1.5R) → exit
6. Profit management: at +0.5% → SL to breakeven; at +1.5R → activate trailing at 1.5× ATR from peak
7. After 13:00, tighten SL to 1× ATR from current price

---

## SYSTEM B: Index Options (F&O)

Lives in `core/options_manager.py`. Trigger pipe is in `main.py:_on_price_update` lines 880-902 (only fires for NIFTY/BANKNIFTY ticks, not stocks, not VIX).

```
9:15-9:30: track ORB high/low for NIFTY index AND BANKNIFTY (independent state machines)
9:30-10:15: every NIFTY/BANKNIFTY tick →
   ├─ already 2 trades today (1 NIFTY + 1 BANKNIFTY max)? → skip
   ├─ VIX > 18? → skip
   ├─ ORB range too tight (<0.2%) or too wide (>1.5% NIFTY / >3.0% BANK)? → skip
   │
   ├─ State machine on the index itself:
   │    NONE → BREAKOUT (LTP past ORB ± 0.1%)
   │         → RETESTING (LTP back to range edge)
   │         → CONFIRM (next candle bounces away)
   │         → fire signal
   │
   ├─ Build option symbol: NIFTY27MAR2625500CE (next Thursday weekly expiry)
   ├─ Look up token from instrument master
   ├─ Get current premium via LTP API
   ├─ Skip if premium > Rs.500 (config.options_max_premium)
   ├─ Place LIMIT BUY for 1 lot (NIFTY=25, BANKNIFTY=15)
   │
   └─ SL = entry × 0.7 (30% loss), Target = entry × 1.5 (50% gain)

monitoring (every second):
   ├─ premium hit SL → market SELL
   ├─ premium hit target → market SELL
   └─ time ≥ 14:00 → SELL (theta decay protection)
```

### Differences from equity

| | Equity | Options |
|---|---|---|
| Watchlist | NIFTY 200 | NIFTY + BANKNIFTY only |
| Strategies | 4 (ORB, VWAP, EMA, SR) | 1 (ORB retest on index) |
| Direction | LONG/SHORT | CE (CALL) / PE (PUT) |
| Stop-loss | ATR-based, 1.0%-1.5% bound | 30% premium loss |
| Target | 1.5R | 50% premium gain |
| Force exit | 3:15 PM | 2:00 PM (theta) |
| Max trades/day | 5 | 2 (1 NIFTY + 1 BANK) |
| Capital cap per trade | Full ₹15K (with leverage) | min(Rs.5000, 30% of capital) = Rs.4500 |
| Signal entry window | 9:30-13:00 | 9:30-10:15 only |
| Filters | 10+ sniper filters, score ≥ 80 | VIX gate + range size only |
| Pre-flight checks | 17 | None |
| Risk manager gate | Yes | No (uses own counter) |
| Score required | 80 | N/A |

### How to run only one of the two systems

**Run only equity (disable F&O):** Edit `config.py` line 324:
```python
options_enabled: bool = False   # was: True
```
Effect: `main.py:131` sets `self.options_manager = None`. All options checks become no-ops.

**Run only options (disable equity):** Easiest — set `min_score_to_trade = 200` in `config.py` line 78. Scanner still runs but no signal can score 200, so all rejected at score gate. Options run untouched.

### Market stance (from macro analysis)

Set on startup based on NIFTY 50/200 DMA + VIX:

| Stance | Conditions | Max trades | Size % |
|---|---|---|---|
| AGGRESSIVE | VIX < 18 + above both DMAs | 5 | 100% |
| MODERATE | VIX < 18 + above 200 DMA only | 3 | 100% |
| DEFENSIVE | VIX 18-25 OR below 200 DMA | 2 | 50% |
| CASH | VIX ≥ 18 | 0 | 0% |

`max_trades_per_day` is dynamically set to `min(config.max_trades_per_day, stance_max_trades)`.

## Safety Rules (HARDCODED — never override without testing)

1. Every trade MUST have a stop-loss
2. Max risk per trade: 1.5% of capital (Rs.225 at 15K capital)
3. Max 5 trades per day (or stance-imposed lower limit: 0 / 2 / 3 / 5)
4. Max 3 losing trades per day
5. Max 80% of broker margin deployed at once
6. Daily loss limit: 3% of starting capital (Rs.450 at 15K)
7. 2 consecutive losses = 15-min trading cooldown
8. 10-min minimum spacing between any two entries
9. 15-min re-entry cooldown per stock after exiting
10. No new trades after 13:00
11. All positions force-closed at 15:15
12. **VIX ≥ 18 = NO TRADES (binary, both equity and F&O)**
13. Choppiness Index > 70 = reject signal (both stock AND NIFTY checked)
14. ATR-based SL bounded 1.0%-1.5% of entry price
15. Score ≥ 80 required (Sniper Mode)
16. Broker-side STOPLOSS-LIMIT order placed for every position (exchange-level safety)
17. Kill switch on dashboard immediately exits all positions

---

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Rule-based, not ML.** Strategies are explicit if/else logic.
2. **Broker-side SL orders for crash safety.** STOPLOSS-LIMIT lives on exchange. Modified on trail. Cancelled before manual exit.
3. **Confluence requirement REMOVED.** Earlier versions required 2+ strategies to agree. Now: highest-confidence single signal goes through. The 10+ filters and 14-factor score gate handle quality.
4. **VIX binary, not graduated.** Earlier `vix_caution_threshold=20`, `vix_caution_size_pct=50` allowed reduced trading at VIX 18-20. Now all set to 18 — VIX 18 = full stop. Reason: VIX > 18 in 2025-2026 only happened during wars/tariffs/crises; bot makes money in VIX 10-18 (90% of days), trading in VIX 18+ adds risk without proportional reward.
5. **Tight SL bounds (1.0%-1.5%).** Previously 0.5%-3%. With 1.5R target, 3% SL = 4.5% target = unreachable intraday. Tightened to favor higher win rate.
6. **Lunch block is FLAG ONLY.** Not a hard block. Reason: choppiness + RVOL + VIX filters already handle low-quality lunch conditions.
7. **WebSocket cache for monitoring.** `monitor_positions()` reads prices from `data_stream.price_cache`, never polls broker LTP API except as fallback. Prevents rate-limit errors.
8. **VIX REST polling fallback.** Angel One WebSocket doesn't reliably stream VIX → bot polls Yahoo Finance every 5 min if WebSocket VIX hasn't arrived.
9. **Pre-seed candles on startup.** Historical API fills today's completed 5-min candles → all strategies ready immediately on late starts.
10. **Position adoption on startup.** `getPosition()` finds orphans → adopts with 2.5% fallback SL → places broker SL.

## Known Active Mismatches

These are real divergences in the code worth knowing:

1. **Live vs backtest strategies differ.** Live: ORB + VWAP_BOUNCE + EMA_CROSS + SR_BREAKOUT. Backtest: ORB + VWAP_REVERSION (the opposite logic). The backtest comment explicitly states: "Old VWAP Bounce: DISABLED (-Rs.1,298 loss)". So the backtest is testing a hypothesis that hasn't been moved to live yet, OR live was never updated to match the proven backtest config. Worth resolving.
2. **Pre-flight check #2 says "confluence is informational"** — comment matches code. No gate.
3. **Pre-flight check #10 (15-min trend) is short-circuited** — `trend_15m_enabled=False`, so always passes.
4. **Trading windows in config are weird:** `trading_window_2_start=13:00`, `trading_window_2_end=13:00` (zero minutes). The risk manager uses `window_1_start (9:30) ≤ now ≤ window_2_end (13:00)` so it works as a continuous 9:30-13:00 window despite the odd config. Could be cleaned up.
5. **Adopted positions get fixed 2.5% SL.** Not ATR-based until next monitoring cycle replaces it. Documented as intentional (no ATR data at adoption time).
6. **Comments reference 2.5R target** in some places (signal_scorer docstring, options_manager comment) but actual config is 1.5R. Inconsistency, not a bug.

## Running the Bot

```powershell
cd C:\Users\rshiv\nse-trading-bot\backend
python main.py              # mode from .env
python main.py --paper      # force paper mode
python main.py --live       # force live mode (REAL money!)
```

Run **before 9:00 AM IST** so the bot has time to authenticate, fetch instrument cache, fetch prev-day OHLC, and pre-seed candles before market opens.

To run the backtest:
```powershell
python backtest.py --start 2026-04-17 --end 2026-04-30
python backtest.py --start 2026-04-17 --end 2026-04-30 --stocks RELIANCE,TCS,INFY
```

Backtest uses **yfinance** (free, no broker auth needed). Note: yfinance only provides 5-min data for the last 60 days.

## Coding Conventions

- **Python**: type hints, dataclasses, `logging` (not print), config via `.env` + `config.py`
- **Error handling**: every API call wrapped in try/except, graceful degradation
- **Security**: keys in `.env` (gitignored), Firebase creds gitignored
- **Angel One specifics**: `-EQ` suffix for tradingsymbol; producttype="INTRADAY" for MIS, "DELIVERY" for CNC
- **WebSocket prices in paise** (divide by 100)
- **Instrument cache** must refresh daily

## User Profile

- **Experience**: Beginner in Python and trading
- **Capital**: Rs.15,000
- **Broker**: Angel One SmartAPI (free)
- **Goal**: Learn algorithmic trading with real but minimal risk
- **Philosophy**: Sniper Mode — fewer, higher-quality trades. Wait for confluence of context (macro/sector/fundamental) + technical signal. Protect capital above all.
